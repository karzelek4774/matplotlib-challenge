# matplotlib-challenge

Introduction: 

This assignment utilizes Pandaa, MatPlotLib, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze a set of data for Pymaceuticals. Pandas utilizes data frames to analyze data from an original csv file. Several techniques were made to analyze the data into the final summary data frames, including cleaning of the data, unique, mean, count, sum, value_counts, set_index, groupby, and sorting. Several plots were also generated and required formatting as well.



Observations/Problems:

I found that I had issues with generating plots on some of my data sets. On further analysis, my data was a mix of array, list, and dataframe format. I found I violated some arguments with tuples as well and had to troubleshoot until I could fix.
